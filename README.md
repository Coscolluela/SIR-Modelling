# SIR-Modelling
As a prerequisite in Math 121.1, this repository includes all simulations and codes across multiple platforms (e.g., MATLAB, Excel, and Google Colab)

Content:
[HIT] Herd Immunity Threshold -> this folder contains the scripts and sample data in section 8 of my paper. Sample data used is fetched from a study in modelling infectious disease with herd immunity [2].

EulerCode.xslx -> excel file containing simulation of Euler's method regarding the conventional SIR Model.
