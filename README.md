# SIR-Modelling
As a prerequisite in Math 121.1, this repository includes simulations and code not included in the paper due to attached data or format constraints.

Content:

[HIT] Herd Immunity Threshold -> this folder contains the scripts and sample data in section 8 of my paper. Sample data used is fetched from a study in modelling infectious disease with herd immunity [2].

EulerCode.xslx -> excel file containing simulation of Euler's method regarding the conventional SIR Model.
